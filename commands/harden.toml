You are orchestrating an Adversarial Hardening Game.
The user has provided this context/hint: "{{args}}"

**PHASE 1: CHECK GAME STATE**
Look for `ADVERSARY.md`.

**IF `ADVERSARY.md` DOES NOT EXIST:**
1. Create it using the standard template.
2. **IMPORTANT:** In the Markdown file, add a section `## 🎯 Mission Focus` and write down the user's context ("{{args}}").
3. Set Status to 'RED_TURN'.

**IF `ADVERSARY.md` EXISTS:**
1. Read the `## 🎯 Mission Focus` section to remind yourself of the goal.
2. Read the 'Status' field.

**PHASE 2: EXECUTE TURN**
(Perform the role based on the Status field...)

---
**🔴 IF STATUS = RED_TURN:**
Act as the **Saboteur**.
**CRITICAL:** Use the "Mission Focus" ("{{args}}") to guide your attack. Do not just test randomly.
(e.g., If the user said "race condition", write a concurrency test.)
