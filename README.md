Here is the complete, raw `README.md` for the agentic version of the extension.

```markdown
# Gemini Adversarial Hardener

Turn your code review into a strategy game. This extension pits an AI **Saboteur** (Red Team) against an AI **Engineer** (Blue Team) to robustly harden your codebase.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install
Navigate to this directory and run:

```bash
gemini extensions install .

```

### 2. Start a Game

Go to any project repo and tell the Red Team what to target:

```bash
/harden "Focus on race conditions in the user auth module"

```

*Gemini will initialize the game board (`ADVERSARY.md`), create a hostile test case, and wait for your signal.*

### 3. Play a Turn

To advance the game (Arbiter judgment -> Engineer fix -> Next Attack), just type:

```bash
/harden

```

### 4. The Loop

* 🔴 **Red Team** writes a test to break your code.
* ⚖️ **Arbiter** validates if the test is fair.
* 🔵 **Blue Team** fixes the code and commits the patch.
* *Repeat until the Red Team runs out of ideas.*

## 📂 Files

* `ADVERSARY.md`: The active game board (auto-generated).
* `tests/test_adversary_*.py`: The hostile tests generated by the Red Team.
