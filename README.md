# Gemini Adversarial Hardener

Turn your code review into a strategy game. This extension pits an AI **Saboteur** (Red Team) against an AI **Engineer** (Blue Team) to robustly harden your codebase.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install
From the command line, run

```bash
gemini extensions install github.com/jglaser/gemini-adversary
````

Or, install locally.  Navigate to this directory and run:

```bash
gemini extensions install .

```

### 2. Start a Game

Go to any project repo and tell the Red Team what to target:

```bash
/harden "Focus on race conditions in the user auth module"

```

*Gemini will initialize the game board (`ADVERSARY.md`), create a hostile test case, and wait for your signal.*

### 3. Play a Turn

To advance the game (Arbiter judgment -> Engineer fix -> Next Attack), just type:

```bash
/harden

```

### 4. The Loop

* 🔴 **Red Team** writes a test to break your code.
* ⚖️ **Arbiter** validates if the test is fair.
* 🔵 **Blue Team** fixes the code and commits the patch.
* *Repeat until the Red Team runs out of ideas.*
